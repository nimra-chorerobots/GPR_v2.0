# Physical-AI Subsurface Perception using GPR

This repository implements a Physical-AI perception stack for autonomous robots equipped with Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR). 

The system allows robots to reason about buried hazards before physical interaction, enabling pre-emptive safety behavior instead of reactive collision avoidance. Therefore, this repository includes a live visualization interface that converts raw GPR signals into real-time subsurface perception displays, making underground hazards directly observable to operators and developers.
